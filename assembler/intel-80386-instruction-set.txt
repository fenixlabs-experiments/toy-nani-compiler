Intel 8088,8086

* Each of the registers, AX, BX, CX and DX could be decomposed into 2 8-bit registers.
** AX register could be decomposed into the AH (upper 8 bits of AX) and AL (lower 8 bits of AL) registers.
* Support up to one megabyte of memory
* Operate only in real mode
* Each segment cannot be larger than 64K

16-bit registers
AX - Accumulator Register
BX - Base Register
CX - Count Register
DX - Data Register
SI - Source Index
DI - Destination Index
BP - Base Pointer
SP - Stack Pointer

* Segment registers
CS - Code Segment
DS - Data Segment
SS - Stack Segment
ES - Extra Segment

* Instruction Pointer (IP) is used with the CS register to keep track of the address of the next instruction executed by the CPU
* Normally, as an instruction is executed, IP is advanced to point to the next instruction in memory
* FLAGS register stores important information about the results of a previous instruction

Intel 80386

* AX is the lower 16-bits of EAX, AL is the lower 8 bits of AX (and EAX)
* 32-bit protected mode, access up to 4 gigabytes
* Programs are divided into segments, but each segments can also be up to 4 gigabytes in size
